#+TITLE:  doom-module-email-mu4e

This package is a refactor of the current =mu4e= module on doom-emacs. It tries to modernize, and
enable more options to the =mu4e= user.

The code in this repository is a mix between [[https://github.com/hlissner][Henrik Lissner]]'s original code, [[https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config/blob/master/config.org][@tecosaur config]], and
some of my personal changes. BTW, if you didn't check [[https://github.com/tecosaur][@tecosaur]]'s config, do yourself a favor, and
spend some quality Elisp time there!
